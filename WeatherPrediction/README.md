## Weather Prediction Algorithms ##

These are the original Matlab files for the prediction algorithms we used. These were written by our teammate Hamid Tizhoosh.

We had a bit of trouble thinking about exactly _how_ we were going to put matlab in our web app, so we ended up completely re-writing these algorithms in javascript.

We've left them here in their original formats if you want to see them, because they have some visualizations. The default # of iterations is 500.
