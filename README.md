# Renewable Energy Explorer (REX) #

## Vision ##

We want to create a renewable energy explorer app that doesn't suck.

We've researched existing solutions. They provide useful data, but their UIs are too complicated.

So, we're creating an app that excites users. We want to provide them with just enough information that will tell them whether they should pursue further research into renewable energy.

Featuring a kick-ass UI, a rating system, machine-learning based weather prediction algorithms and access to experts, our app eases users into the world of renewable energy.


## What We Have ##
